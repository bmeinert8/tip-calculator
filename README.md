## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and Grid for layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript for calculations and interactivity
- Git and GitHub for version control

### What I Learned

- Improved my understanding of responsive design using a mobile-first approach.
- Gained experience with JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation for dynamic calculations.
- Learned to handle edge cases (e.g., preventing `$NaN` outputs, validating inputs).

### Continued Development

I plan to enhance this project with additional features, including:

- A tip history log to track past calculations.
- Custom tip presets for user-defined percentages.
- A split payment breakdown for detailed per-person contributions.
- A currency selector for multi-currency support.
- A dark mode toggle for better usability.
- A shareable link to share calculations via URL.
